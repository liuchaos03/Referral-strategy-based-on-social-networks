(1) In order to meet the requirements of reviewers, we use genetic algorithm and simulated annealing algorithm as our benchmark models.
(2) In order to speed up the calculation, we optimized the code for parallel calculation.
Note that we do not recommend you run programs with a network size of more than 100 on your personal computer; 
The computer we used was configured with 64 cores, 128 threads, and 512G-RAM.
